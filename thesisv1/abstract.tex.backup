\textbf{\large Abstract}
\end{center}

Nowadays, aside from conventional text processors or editors, LaTeX is an alternative choice for
authors with different fields of expertise. It also introduces a completely new philosophy, which differs
from many popular text editors, to its user, and easily becomes the most used typesetting system among
academic environment. In 1977, Donald E.Knuth first developed the TeX system, which later received
further development to become what is known today as LaTeX by Leslie Lamport. Its raison d'Ãªtre was
(and will always be) providing ultilities for authors to leave the visual design to the typesetting
system, and instead, focus on the contents of their works.\par
Realising that LaTeX is appropriate for composing text with clear and unified standards, and the system
itself allows users to design layouts and styles for custom types of documents, this thesis was conceived
with the purpose is to design, build a template for bachelor theses. This template will help students spend
less time in designing and formating the visual design of their theses or reports and concentrate more on
the contents and logical structure of components of their works, staying true to the ideal of LaTeX's creators.\par
This thesis integrated necessary packages, configurations and definitions for new commands (or control sequences as Knuth calls them)
into a single class file, which will form a standard layout for bachelor theses and reports, the thesis also
includes introductory manual to guide users in creating LaTeX environment as well as composing a simple LaTeX input file, which
is then built into a human-readable document.\par
Due to time constraints, the produced class file is still having many flaws, and in need of
test-run to evaluate performance and any necessary adjustments. However, the product is enough
to become a foundation for future develoments; moreover, this thesis's report has detailed analysis
on the structure of the class file and assembles essential documentation, which, when combined with
the class file, will serve as a guildline and reference for anyone who want to build their own class or
package for LaTeX.\par
The thesis's directions for future developments include (for more detailed directions, please read chapter 4 of the report):
